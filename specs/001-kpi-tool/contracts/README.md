# Contracts

This directory contains interface contracts and type definitions for the Product KPIs tool.

## Files

- `kpi_interface.py` - Defines the `BaseKPI` abstract class and related types that all KPIs must implement

## Purpose

These contracts serve as:
1. **Documentation** - Clear specification of what each component must implement
2. **Type Reference** - IDE/editor support for type hints
3. **Test Fixtures** - Base for creating mock implementations in tests

## Note

These are specification files. The actual implementation code lives in `src/`.
